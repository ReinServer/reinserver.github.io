  <div class="big-text">Network Rules:</div>
  <br>
  <p><i>"follow them or you'll be permabannedTM"</i></p>
  <br>
  <p>As always when running a server, we need to have rules to ensure a smooth and fair experience for all. As such, please follow these rules, or you risk a <b>ban.</b></p>
  <br>
  <div class="med-text">Global Rules:</div>
  <p>These rules apply to all servers, except the Anarchy Server.</p>
  <br>
  <p>• Do not join any server with a hack client.</p>
  <p>• Do not spam chat or voice chat.</p>
  <p>• Do not send any unfavourable or inappropiate messages in chat or in voice chat.</p>
  <p>• Do not attempt to undermine the server's efforts to provide every player a fair playing experience, by either duping rare items, keeping illegal items or attempting to lag or crash the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not attack or harrass any player, be it in-game or external. Racism is not tolerated.</p>
  <p>• Do not spoof or hack into other people's accounts.</p>
  <p>• Do not create and play on another account to bypass your ban.</p>
  <p>• Do not scam people for real-life money.</p>
  <p>• Do not be an asshole.</p>
  <p>• These rules are not exhaustive. Please have common sense and remember that rule breaks are at the discretion of the admins.</p>
  <br>
  <div class="med-text">MN101 SMP Rules:</div>
  <p>These rules only apply to the MN101 SMP. Global rules still apply.</p>
  <br>
  <p>• Do not hack on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not xRay on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not combat log on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not grief the mall on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not abuse exploits or glitches that allow you to gain an unfair advantage on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not grief other people's bases and property on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not steal other people's stuff on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not scam other people on the server.</p>
  <p>• PVP is only allowed in the overworld and end if both players agree to PVP. <b>KOS is allowed outside nether spawn!</b></p>
  <p>• These rules are not exhaustive. Please have common sense.</p>
  <br>
  <div class="med-text">LifeSteal SMP Rules:</div>
  <p>These rules only apply to the LifeSteal SMP. Global rules still apply.</p>
  <br>
  <p>• Do not hack on the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not xRay on the server.</p>

  <p>• Stealing and griefing other people's bases is only allowed <b>when the player you're stealing from or griefing is online.</b></p>
  <p>• These rules are not exhaustive. Please have common sense.</p>
  <br>
  <div class="med-text">Creative SMP Rules:</div>
  <p>These rules only apply to the Creative SMP. Global rules still apply.</p>
  <br>
  <p>• Do not completely destroy or nuke the server.</p>
  <p>• Do not spawn entities.</p>
  <p>• Do not crash the server.</p>
  <p>• Your main goal shouldn't be to take away from a community, <b>it's to build upon.</b></p>
  <p>• These rules are not exhaustive. Please have common sense.</p>
  <br>
  <div class="med-text">ReinServer Anarchy Rules:</div>
  <p>These rules only apply to the Anarchy server. Global rules do not apply unless specified otherwise.</p>
  <br>
  <p>• You are allowed to hack, PvP, dupe and KOS on the server.</p>
  <p>• You are not allowed to abuse any glitch or exploit on the server that allows game-breaking exploits, such as backdoors, operator status, and obtaining illegal items such as bedrock and enchantment levels above normal obtainment.</p>
  <p>• You are not allowed to abuse any glitch that causes server disruption or lag.</p>
  <p>• You are not allowed to harrass or attack people, whether it be in-game or external. Remember it's a block game.</p>
  <br>
  <p><b>By playing on the ReinServer Network, you agree to follow all the rules posted above. Failure to follow these rules may result in a warn, mute, kick, temporary/permanent ban or IP ban.</b></p>
